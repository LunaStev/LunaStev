## About Me

Hi, I'm **LunaStev** — an independent developer currently working under the future **Wave Foundation**.  
Although I'm a one-person team for now, my goal is to build a foundation that will shape the future of programming.  

I've explored many languages, but I primarily work with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), [C](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/)/[C++](https://isocpp.org/), and [Python](https://python.org).

All inquiries are welcome — business, personal, or recruitment.
